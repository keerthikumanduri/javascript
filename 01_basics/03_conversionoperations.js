//NOTES

//"55" => 55 - whenever we try to convert a number to a number it can easily be converted to a number.

//"55abc" => NaN - Whenever we try to convert a term like 55abc to a number it gives an output as NaN(not a number). but the type of 55abc is still a number.

//true => 1; false =>0

//let isLoggedin = "" //here we are trying to check if the number 1 is boolean(true) or not.

//let booleanIsLoggedIn = Boolean(isLoggedin)
//console.log(booleanIsLoggedIn);

//it is indeed boolean since the output we got is 1 which tells that it is TRUE.Therefore numbers can be converted to boolean.

// when we assign a value of :

// 1 => True; 0 => false
// "" => False
// "Rama" => True
 
let someNumber = 55

//let stringNumber = String(someNumber)
//console.log(stringNumber);
//console.log(typeof stringNumber);

//here above we have converted a number to string.

let value = 3
